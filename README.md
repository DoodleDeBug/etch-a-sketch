# etch-a-sketch
TOP etch-a-sketch project

## What I learnt:
* DOM manipulation
* I really struggled with resizing the grid, but I eventually figured it out with some help from the TOP community
* Practiced using "e.target"


## Things to improve:
* One of extra things I wanted to add was a "shade" feature but I chickened out because it seemed like a lot of work
* A lot of the other examples on TOP have a colour picker feature that looks cool, would be nice to add that
